# Online Bank system 
-------------------
The main aim is to create an online banking platform accessible from any location, so customers need not go to the bank branches for routine banking operations like money withdrawal, money transfer, balance inquiry, etc. Visiting the banks can be time-consuming and hectic, it'll cause long queues at the bank,Â and customers don't need to go to the bank for every minor banking task. These issues can be solved by making an online banking system for customers to use.
